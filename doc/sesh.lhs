\section{What is Priority Sesh?}\label{sec:main}

We introduce Priority Sesh in three steps: in~\cref{sec:one-shot}, we build a small library of \emph{linear} or \emph{one-shot channels} based on MVars~\cite{peytonjonesgordon96}; in~\cref{sec:sesh}, we use these one-shot channels to build a small library of \emph{session-typed channels} \cite{dardhgiachino12}; and in~\cref{sec:priority-sesh}, we decorate these session types with \emph{priorities} to guarantee deadlock-freedom \cite{kokkedardha21}.

Priority Sesh is written in Linear Haskell~\cite{bernardyboespflug18}. The type |%1 ->| is syntactic sugar for the linear arrow @%1->@. Familiar definitions refer to linear variants packaged with \texttt{linear-base}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/}} (\eg, |Functor|, |Bifunctor|, |Monad|) or with Priority Sesh (\eg, |MVar|). For clarity, we refer to the linear |IO| monad from \texttt{linear-base} as |Linear.IO|.

We colour the Haskell definitions which are a part of Sesh:
\begin{itemize*}[font=\bfseries]
\item[\tm{red}] for functions and constructors;
\item[\ty{blue}] for types and type families; and
\item[\cs{emerald}] for priorities and type families acting on priorities.
\end{itemize*}

\subsection{One-shot channels}\label{sec:one-shot}

We start by building a small library of \emph{linear} or \emph{one-shot channels}, \ie, channels over which a value must be sent or received \emph{exactly once}.

The one-shot channels are at the core of our library, and their efficiency is crucial to the overall efficiency of Priority Sesh. However, we do not aim to present an efficient implementation here. Rather, we aim to present a compact implementation with the correct behaviour.

\paragraph{Channels}
A~one-shot channel has two endpoints, |SendOnce| and |RecvOnce|, which are two copies of the same |MVar|:

\begin{spec}
newtype SendOnce  a = MkSendOnce (MVar a)
newtype RecvOnce  a = MkRecvOnce (MVar a)

newOneShot :: Linear.IO (SendOnce a, RecvOnce a)
newOneShot = do  (mvar_s, mvar_r) <- dup2 <$> newEmptyMVar
                 return (MkSendOnce (unur mvar_s), MkRecvOnce (unur mvar_r))
\end{spec}

The |newEmptyMVar| function returns an \emph{unrestricted} |MVar|, which may be used non-linearly. The |dup2| function creates two (unrestricted) copies of the |MVar|. The |unur| function casts each \emph{unrestricted} copy to a \emph{linear} copy. Thus, we end up with two copies of an |MVar|, each of which must be used \emph{exactly once}.

We implement |sendOnce| and |recvOnce| as aliases for the corresponding |MVar| operations:

\begin{spec}
sendOnce :: SendOnce a %1 -> a %1 -> Linear.IO ()
sendOnce (MkSendOnce mvar_s) x = putMVar mvar_s x

recvOnce :: RecvOnce a %1 -> Linear.IO a
recvOnce (MkRecvOnce mvar_r)= takeMVar mvar_r
\end{spec}

The |MVar| operations implement the correct blocking behaviour for asynchronous one-shot channels: the |sendOnce| operation is non-blocking, and the |recvOnce| operations blocks until a value becomes available.

\paragraph{Synchronisation}
We use |SendOnce| and |RecvOnce| to implement a construct for one-shot synchronisation between two processes, |SyncOnce|, which consists of two one-shot channels. To synchronise, each process sends a unit on the one channel, then waits to receive a unit on the other channel:

\begin{spec}
type SyncOnce = (SendOnce (), RecvOnce ())

newSync :: Linear.IO (SyncOnce, SyncOnce)
newSync = do  (mvar_s1, mvar_r1) <- newOneShot
              (mvar_s2, mvar_r2) <- newOneShot
              return ((mvar_s1, mvar_r2), (mvar_s2, mvar_r1))

syncOnce :: SyncOnce %1 -> Linear.IO ()
syncOnce (mvar_s, mvar_r) = do sendOnce mvar_s (); recvOnce mvar_r
\end{spec}


\paragraph{Cancellation}


\subsection{Session-typed channels}\label{sec:sesh}

\begin{spec}
class (Session (Dual s) , Dual (Dual s) ~ s) => Session s
  where
    type Dual s = result | result -> s
    new :: Linear.IO (s, Dual s)
\end{spec}

We define |spawn|, which spawns off a new thread, as essentially an alias of |forkLinearIO|.

\begin{spec}
data RawSend a s  = (Session s) => MkRawSend (SendOnce (a, Dual s))
data RawRecv a s  = (Session s) => MkRawRecv (RecvOnce (a, s))
data RawEnd       = MkRawEnd SyncOnce
\end{spec}

\begin{spec}
instance Session s => Session (RawSend a s)
  where
    type Dual (RawSend a s) = RawRecv a (Dual s)
    new = bimap MkRawSend MkRawRecv <$> newOneShot

instance Session s => Session (RawRecv a s)
  where
    type Dual (RawRecv a s) = RawSend a (Dual s)
    new = bimap MkRawRecv MkRawSend . swap <$> newOneShot

instance Session RawEnd
  where
    type Dual RawEnd = RawEnd
    new = MkRawEnd <$> newSync
\end{spec}

Where |quiet| suppresses any |BlockedIndefinitelyOnMVar| errors.

\begin{spec}
send :: (a, RawSend a s) %1 -> Linear.IO s
send (x, MkRawSend mvar_s) = do
  (here, there) <- new
  () <- quiet $ sendOnce mvar_s (x, there)
  return here

recv :: RawRecv a s %1 -> Linear.IO (a, s)
recv (MkRawRecv mvar_r) = recvOnce mvar_r

close :: RawEnd %1 -> Linear.IO ()
close (MkRawEnd sync) = quiet $ syncOnce sync

cancel :: Session s => s %1 -> Linear.IO ()
cancel s = return $ consume s
\end{spec}

\begin{spec}
connect ::  Session s => (s %1 -> Linear.IO ()) %1 ->
            (Dual s %1 -> Linear.IO a) %1 -> Linear.IO a
connect k1 k2 = do (s1, s2) <- new; spawn (k1 s1); k2 s2
\end{spec}


\subsection{Session-typed channels with priority}\label{sec:priority-sesh}

Priorities are either |Bot|, a~natural number, or |Top|. A~natural number priority represents the time at which some action happens---the lower the number, the sooner it happens. The values |Top| and |Bot| are used as the identities for |`Min`| and |`Max`| in lower and upper bounds on priorities, respectively. We let |o| range over natural numbers, |p| over \emph{lower bounds}, and |q| over \emph{upper bounds}.

\begin{spec}
data Priority = Bot | Val Nat | Top
\end{spec}

We define strict inequality ($|`LT`|$), minimum (|`Min`|), and maximum (|`Max`|) on priorities as usual.

We define |Send o|, |Recv o|, and |End o|, which decorate the raw sessions from~\cref{sec:sesh} with the priority |o| of the communication action, \ie, when does the communication happen? Duality (|Dual|) preserves these priorities. Operationally, these types are mere wrappers.

We define a graded monad |Sesh p q|, which decorates |Linear.IO| with a lower bound |p| and an upper bound |q| on the priorities of its communication actions, \ie, if you run the monad, when does communication begin and end?

\begin{spec}
newtype Sesh p q a = MkSesh { runSeshIO :: Linear.IO a }
\end{spec}

The monad operations for |Sesh p q| merely wrap those for |Linear.IO|, hence trivially obeys the monad laws.

The |ireturn| function returns a \emph{pure} computation---the type |Sesh Top Bot| guarantees that all communications happen between |Top| and |Bot|, hence there can be no communication at all!

\begin{spec}
ireturn :: aÂ %1 -> Sesh Top Bot a
ireturn x = MkSesh $ return x
\end{spec}

The |>>>=| operator sequences two actions with types |Sesh p q| and |Sesh p' q'|, and requires |LT q p'|, \ie, the first action must have finished before the second starts. The resulting action has lower bound |Min p p'| and upper bound |Max q q'|.

\begin{spec}
(>>>=) :: (LT q p') => Sesh p q a %1 -> (a %1-> Sesh p' q' b) %1 -> Sesh (Min p p') (Max q q') b
mx >>>= mf = MkSesh $ runSeshIO mx >>= \x -> runSeshIO (mf x)
\end{spec}

We define similar wrappers for the concurrency and communication primitives:
\begin{itemize*}[label=\empty]
\item |send|, |recv|, and |close| each perform a communication action with some priority |o|, and return a computation of type |Sesh o o|, \ie, with \emph{exact} bounds;
\item |new|, |spawn|, and |cancel| don't perform any communication action, and so return a \emph{pure} computation of type |Sesh Top Bot|.
\end{itemize*}

\begin{spec}
send     :: Session s => (a, Send o a s) %1 -> Sesh (Val o) (Val o) s
recv     :: Session s => Recv o a s %1 -> Sesh (Val o) (Val o) (a, s)
close    :: End o %1 -> Sesh (Val o) (Val o) ()
new      :: Session s => Sesh Top Bot (s, Dual s)
spawn    :: Sesh p q () %1 -> Sesh Top Bot ()
cancel   :: Session s => s %1 -> Sesh Top Bot ()
\end{spec}
